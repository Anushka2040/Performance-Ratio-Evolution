# Performance-Ratio-Evolution
The dataset consists of three columns:
1.	Date (July 2019 to present)
2.	PR (Performance Ratio) – This parameter is used to track the daily performance of the PV plant. A high value indicates that the plant is performing well and there are no issues. 
3.	GHI (Irradiation) – This parameter tracks the total irradiation for a particular day. A high value indicates a sunny day.

# About the output
-	The red line on the graph represents the 30-d moving average of the PR (Performance Evolution) whereas the scatter points depict the GHI. 

-	The dark green line represents the budget line. The value begins from 73.9 and should reduce by 0.8% every year. The values are:

  -> 73.9 for the first year (July 2019 to June 2020) </br>
  -> 73.3 for the second year (July 2020 to June 2021) </br>
  -> 72.7 for the third year (July 2021 to present)

-	The points for the scatter plot are colour coded (as per the legend above). That is: if the GHI [Daily Irradiation] is:

 -> Less than 2: Navy blue </br>
 -> 2-4: Light blue </br>
 -> 4-6: Orange </br>
 -> >6: Brown </br>

-	The points above Target Budget PR represent the number of PR points above the Budget PR for that particular year.

-	The bottom right section of the graph simply shows the average PR for the last 7 days, the last 30 days, last 60 days and so on.
